# Hi, I’m Trang Vũ
## Senior Software Designer

Focusing my energy on creating data visualizations and digital experiences for positive change since I like to spend my days doing something that aligns with my personal values: balance, inclusivity, sustainability. 

Previously, I served as a **software design lead** for several years, and before that, I crafted frontends for various operational dashboards and systems.

My temporary work portfolio is available on <a href="https://trang-vu.notion.site/141a20a912114958b81a5869916cf9cb?v=7046a53bc0714379ab15bdabbb766028&pvs=4" target="_blank">this Notion public site</a>.

Here's a list of a few things I enjoy in my spare time: drinking loose-leaf tea, journaling, exploring wild gastronomy, <a href="https://unsplash.com/@heycharlo" target="_blank">wandering in greenery with my camera</a>, playing football.

Anyway, I’m very much open to part-time collaboration on fun data storytelling. So, if it’s something on your mind, feel free to say hi.

Take care.

Trang (pronounced as *Cha-an*)
