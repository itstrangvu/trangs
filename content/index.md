# Hi, Iâ€™m Trang

Focusing my energy on creating data visualizations and digital experiences for positive change since I like to spend my days doing something that aligns with my personal values: balance, inclusivity, sustainability. ðŸŒ¸

Previously, I served as a software design lead for several years, and before that, I crafted frontends for various operational dashboards and systems.

Here's a list of a few things I enjoy in my spare time: drinking loose-leaf tea, journaling, exploring wild gastronomy, wandering in greenery, community cooking.

Anyway, Iâ€™m very much open to collaboration for fun data storytelling, so if itâ€™s something on your mind, feel free to say hi.

Take care *xoxo*
