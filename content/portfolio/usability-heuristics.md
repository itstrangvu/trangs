## Context

Since I needed to recall the usability heuristics, I decided to create this web page that would serve as a cheat sheet and contain just the information in a condensed, memorable way. 

## Details

The page is built with pure HTML and CSS, no JS. 
The numbering is generated using CSS counter. 

As for the layout, I decided to ditch flex box and applied CSS grid instead. 



## Areas for improvement

1. Accessibility – make sure the website is accessible according to WCAG AAA standard

1. Responsiveness – tablet and mobile breakpoints are yet to be done
