# Context

In collaboration with two other homies, we created an interactive piece using Kinect 2, laptop, projector and sound system. 



I was responsible for the visual output based on interactivity. For the coding part, I used OpenCV and Processing. 



Iâ€™d be more than happy to share more info upon request. 



P.S. I also put together a website quick for other projects too for the verni. Each project would have its own QR code. Ours led to here: [https://itt7projektu.firebaseapp.com/03.html](https://itt7projektu.firebaseapp.com/03.html)
