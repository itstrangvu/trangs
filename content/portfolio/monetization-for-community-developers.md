# Opportunities



Apify has a community of developers who can publish their Actors to the Store and get revenue this way. 

There were three pricing models: 

- Free

- Rental

- Pay-per-result



In the pilot phase, if a community developer wanted to get paid, they had to reach out to support. As the developer community grew, more support tickets related to monetization were incoming so the community team decided to release the self-service monetization feature in console. 



# Research

First of all, I had a quick huddle with a customer support folk on Slack to get informed on the specific issues tied to monetization (i.e. Billing etc.). I also wrote on Discord to the community channel to ask what steps the developer went through before monetizing their Actors. 



After that, we had a requirements meeting with the product owner and developer to understand the billing system limitations. 

I created two diagrams to make sure I have all the dots connected. 

# Building

There were several restraints:

- Fit it inside the Publication tab

- Use the design system for console

- The billing details and payment method is set for all Actors



# Testing

Tested with 2 developers afterwards. 



# Outcomes

After 2 months:

- Decrease of support tickets for the monetization

- Increase on the community developer revenue



I am happy to provide more details upon request.
