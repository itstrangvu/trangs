This is a catalogue of principles that drive me now. 

### Meet people 

And meet them in a way so that you can see where they’re at conceptually, emotionally. Verbally recognize their wisdom and emphasize when things go well.

### Stay real

Give zero fuel to poor behavior, bad ideas, performative smartness. Focus your emotional and intellectual energy on the right things.

### Careful curation

Escape the algorithm by selecting information content with intention. Also consider stepping away from your screen and doing something completely different and unrelated. 

Sometimes I visit this[ reddit nosurf channel](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/) to check out how others do it. 

### Trust

Trust needs to be earned and is a glue to quality relationships. 

### Warmth

Antidote to negativity is warmth, not positivity. Positivity tells a sad person that there is no reason to be sad. Warmth asks the sad person if they want to go get some ice cream. 

### Healthy self-competition

When you compete with someone else, you let their values define your goals and the perception of your own performance. Define your values, embrace growth mindset and set ambitious, exciting goals. Progress over success – celebrate incremental accomplishments and enjoy the journey.
