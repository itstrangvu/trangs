This is a catalogue of principles that drive me now. 

### Meet people 

And meet them in a way so that you can see where they’re at conceptually, emotionally. Verbally recognize their wisdom and emphasize when things go well.

### Stay real

Give zero fuel to poor behavior, bad ideas, performative smartness. Focus your emotional and intellectual energy on the right things.

### Progress over success

Celebrate incremental accomplishments and enjoying the journey.

### Context > consistency

When it comes to design, I think designing around the current context is better than designing to satisfy prior consistency. 

### Careful curation

Escape the algorithm by selecting information content with intention. Also consider stepping away from your screen and doing something completely different and unrelated. 

### Warmth

Antidote to negativity is warmth, not positivity. Feeling down? I won’t cheer you up.
