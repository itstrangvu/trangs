This is a catalogue of principles that drives me now. 



### 8/8/8

8 hours for work, 8 hours for life, 8 hours of sleep. That’s a fair formula for a balanced life. 



### Context > consistency

When it comes to design, I think designing around the current context is better than designing to satisfy prior consistency. 



### Careful curation

Escape the algorithm by selecting information content with intention. Also consider stepping away from your screen and doing something completely different and unrelated. 



### 3C Model of Motivation

By asking yourself three simple questions, you can analyse the reasons why you struggle to feel motivated.

1. Head: “Is this task really important to me and relevant to my goal?”

1. Heart: “Do I enjoy this task?”

1. Hand: “Am I good at this task?”
