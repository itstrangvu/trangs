This is a catalogue of principles that drive me now. 

### Meet people 

And meet them in a way so that you can see where theyâ€™re at conceptually, emotionally. Verbally recognize their wisdom and emphasize when things go well.

### Stay real

Give zero fuel to poor behavior, bad ideas, performative smartness. Focus your emotional and intellectual energy on the right things.

### Progress over success

Celebrate incremental accomplishments and enjoying the journey.

### Careful curation

Escape the algorithm by selecting information content with intention. Also consider stepping away from your screen and doing something completely different and unrelated. 

### Warmth

Antidote to negativity is warmth, not positivity. Positivity tells a sad person that there is no reason to be sad. Warmth asks the sad person if they want to go get some ice cream.
