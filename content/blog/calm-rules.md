Growing up in a small town in a house with a garden ingrained in me a deep appreciation for the sounds of nature and calmness.

Now I live in downtown Prague, which is tremendously noisy. Noise pollution is everywhere, from roadworks and tourist groups yelling their drunken anthems to cars and motorbikes vrooming under my windows. At some point, I had to protect my hearing to stay serene in the midst of tumultuous life.

## Nature

Regular ventures into nature are crucial to me. I take trips by train, on foot, or by bike, ideally near a lively body of water such as a stream, spring, or lake, as I love the gurgling sounds of water. Spring is lovely, with an abundance of bird chirping. If I don’t have the option to escape the city, I compensate by visiting a nearby university botanical garden (which offers free entrance to all open areas) with my camera and a book, and I relax there for at least two hours.

## Earplugs to the rescue

Earplugs help a lot. My quality of life has increased exponentially thanks to these little gems made of silicone. I put them on whenever I need to take public transport. Let me tell you, there’s a lot of buzz in shared spaces. It’s relieving to filter out unnecessary noise – especially negative remarks from bitter folks.

I also keep a pair or two at my workplace by my desk. The daily average number of people who curse in our room is three. I mean, it’s good to let your frustration out, but hey, I need to focus on my work. So if you need to talk to me, wave.

I like to think of earplugs as masks for ear canals.

## Balance

Of course, there is a time and a place for excitement, euphoria, joy, and even nervous anticipation. But living at the extremes of emotion for an extended period is exhausting. Layering extreme emotions over daily stress and uncertainty equals chaos.



I seek simplicity and serenity whenever I can. Calmness is a welcome tonic that brings me back into balance, offering clarity, serenity, and quiet genius.
