I made a promise to myself: to never stop going on the occasional “random quests”, both online and offline. There’s something exhilarating about an impromptu journey without a set destination, whether it’s wandering around the internet or heading to a local concert venue to support emerging artists. 

Rather than passively taking what’s handed to me, I choose to discover, research, and refine my tastes. It keeps life interesting and ensures I’m always learning something new.

Here’s to the curation and to the curators.
