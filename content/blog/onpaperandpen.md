Chronicle your life your way, with no conventions holding you back. Put your ideas, discoveries and observations on paper, in writing or pictures. Let your journal be the keeper of the things you did today, the things you want to do someday, and your ultimate dreams. Capture each day in the pages of your own unique journal, and then look back on everything you’ve written and drawn. In the big blank space on each page, anything goes. There are no rules – it’s all up to you.
