Let me put a quote from Audre Lorde here: 

> I have come to believe that caring for myself is not self indulgent. Caring for myself is an act of survival. 



Self-care is ongoing. It's not a one and done fix for everything. So I strive to take care of myself today, and tomorrow, and the next day.
