This is the ideal setting/environment for me to work effectively as a product designer. 

### Build with the end users in mind 

Implement continuous research, talk to the users on a regular basis and gather the insights.

### Meaningful direction

Remind the purpose of long term goals. 

### Aim for clarity

Make data-informed decisions, articulate ideas properly. 

### Decide and move on

There isn't always a best answer. The important thing is to make a decision, and move on.

### Measure progress with actual work

Create small scoped tasks where you can show a diff in a design/code file. 

### Give (radically candid) feedback along the way

We can hop on a 1on1 call/chat anytime. 

### Make a space for cross-functional teams

Ping-pong between designer and developer.

### Look back and celebrate

Crucial to keep the team motivated. 

### Context > consistency

When it comes to design, I think designing around the current context is better than designing to satisfy prior consistency. 



So, these are the main points that come to my mind. Most of them are must-haves and I will challenge the status quo when the work setting lacks any of these.
